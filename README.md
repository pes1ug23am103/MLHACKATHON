## Project Overview

The MLHACKATHON repository is designed to showcase modern machine learning techniques through interactive and playful applications. The key highlight is the "HangmanHMM" notebook, which demonstrates training a smart agent to play Hangman using HMMs, along with evaluations and progress tracking using Jupyter widgets.

## Features

- **Hangman Smart Agent:** Trains and evaluates a Hangman game agent using a Hidden Markov Model for improved guess accuracy.
- **Jupyter Notebook Interactivity:** Live progress tracking using widgets for training and evaluation stages.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Official evaluation phase for robust game-playing performance.
- **Colab Compatibility:** Optimized for running in Google Colab.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the project locally or in the cloud.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
- Required Python packages (see notebook or requirements.txt if present)
  - Typical packages: `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `ipywidgets`

### Running the Project

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Yogibear102/MLHACKATHON.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
    ```bash
    cd MLHACKATHON
    ```
3. **Open the Main Notebook:**
    - Start Jupyter Notebook and open `HangmanHMM.ipynb`, or upload the notebook to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).

4. **Follow Notebook Instructions:**
    - Execute the cells in sequence.
    - Track training progress using embedded widgets.

## Repository Structure

- `HangmanHMM.ipynb` : Jupyter notebook implementing the Hangman smart agent.
- Additional files and scripts may further support model training, evaluation, or other experiments.

## Usage

The primary usage is interactive:

- **Train the Agent:** The notebook will guide you through training the HMM-based smart agent.
- **Monitor Progress:** Live widgets show training and evaluation status.
- **Experiment:** You can tweak model parameters and try your own words/lists.
